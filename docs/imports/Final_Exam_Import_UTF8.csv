Title,File Systems Limitation,,,
QuestionText,Which of the following is NOT a major limitation of file-based systems?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,Data separation and isolation,,File-based systems do have data separation issues where each program manages its own files.
Option,100,Improved data security,,Correct! File-based systems actually have POOR data security. This is one of their major limitations not an advantage.
Option,0,Data duplication and redundancy,,File-based systems suffer from data being stored multiple times across different files.
Option,0,Application-data dependence,,File-based systems tightly couple data structure to application code making changes difficult.
Hint,Think about what file-based systems are BAD at - the question asks for what is NOT a limitation.,,
Feedback,The five major limitations of file-based systems are: data separation; data duplication; data dependence; incompatible file formats; and fixed queries. Improved security is not one of them!,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-002,,,
Title,Database System Components,,,
QuestionText,What are the two main components of a database system?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,Tables and Queries,,These are database objects but not the main components of the system.
Option,100,Database and DBMS,,Correct! A database system consists of the Database (shared collection of data) and the DBMS (software to manage it).
Option,0,DDL and DML,,These are database languages not the main components of the system.
Option,0,Users and Administrators,,These are roles in the database environment not system components.
Hint,Think about the data itself and the software that manages it.,,
Feedback,A database system has two key parts: the Database (logically related data and its description) and the DBMS (software enabling users to define create maintain and control access).,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-003,,,
Title,DDL Purpose,,,
QuestionText,What does DDL stand for and what is it used for?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,100,Data Definition Language - defines database structure,,Correct! DDL includes commands like CREATE TABLE ALTER TABLE and DROP TABLE to define the schema.
Option,0,Data Display Language - shows query results,,There is no such language in database systems.
Option,0,Data Deletion Language - removes records,,Deletion is part of DML (DELETE statement) not DDL.
Option,0,Database Design Logic - plans schemas,,While related to design this is not what DDL stands for.
Hint,Think about the language used to CREATE and ALTER table structures.,,
Feedback,DDL (Data Definition Language) defines the database structure using commands like CREATE ALTER and DROP. DML (Data Manipulation Language) manipulates data using SELECT INSERT UPDATE DELETE.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-004,,,
Title,ANSI-SPARC Architecture,,,
QuestionText,What are the three levels of the ANSI-SPARC architecture?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,User Application Database,,These are not the three levels of the ANSI-SPARC architecture.
Option,100,External Conceptual Internal,,Correct! These represent the view level logical level and physical level respectively.
Option,0,Physical Logical Virtual,,While similar these are not the exact terms used in ANSI-SPARC.
Option,0,Client Server Storage,,This describes a different type of architecture (three-tier application architecture).
Hint,Remember: users see views; designers see the logical schema; system sees physical storage.,,
Feedback,ANSI-SPARC has three levels: External (user views); Conceptual (complete logical structure); Internal (physical storage). This separation provides data independence.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-005,,,
Title,Controlled Access Features,,,
QuestionText,Which of the following is NOT one of the four controlled access features provided by a DBMS?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,Security System,,Security is one of the four controlled access features protecting against unauthorized access.
Option,0,Integrity Constraints,,Integrity constraints ensure data accuracy and consistency - this is one of the four features.
Option,100,Query Optimization,,Correct! While important query optimization is not one of the four controlled access features.
Option,0,Concurrency Control,,Concurrency control manages simultaneous access - this is one of the four features.
Hint,The four features are about controlling WHO accesses data WHAT rules data must follow HOW multiple users work together and RECOVERY from failures.,,
Feedback,The four controlled access features are: Security System; Integrity Constraints; Concurrency Control; and Recovery Services. Query optimization is separate.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-006,,,
Title,Relational Model Tuple,,,
QuestionText,In the relational model what is a tuple?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,A column in a table,,This describes an attribute not a tuple.
Option,100,A row in a table,,Correct! A tuple is a row representing a single record in the relation.
Option,0,A constraint on data,,This describes an integrity constraint not a tuple.
Option,0,A relationship between tables,,This describes a foreign key relationship not a tuple.
Hint,Think about the individual records in your Movies table - each movie is one...,,
Feedback,Key terms: Relation=table; Tuple=row; Attribute=column; Domain=allowed values; Degree=number of columns; Cardinality=number of rows.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-007,,,
Title,Primary Key Definition,,,
QuestionText,What type of key uniquely identifies each tuple in a relation?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,Foreign Key,,A foreign key references another table's primary key but doesn't uniquely identify tuples in its own table.
Option,0,Candidate Key,,A candidate key CAN uniquely identify tuples but may not be the chosen key.
Option,100,Primary Key,,Correct! The primary key is the chosen candidate key that uniquely identifies each tuple.
Option,0,Alternate Key,,An alternate key is a candidate key that was NOT chosen as primary.
Hint,This is the ONE key you choose to uniquely identify every row in your table.,,
Feedback,Primary Key = the chosen candidate key for unique identification. Candidate Keys = minimal superkeys. Foreign Key = references another table's primary key. Alternate Key = non-chosen candidate key.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-008,,,
Title,Relational Algebra Selection,,,
QuestionText,Which relational algebra operation selects specific rows from a relation based on a condition?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,Projection (π),,Projection selects specific COLUMNS (vertical subset) not rows.
Option,100,Selection (σ),,Correct! Selection chooses specific ROWS based on a condition (horizontal subset).
Option,0,Union (∪),,Union combines tuples from two relations not selecting rows from one.
Option,0,Join (⋈),,Join combines tuples from TWO relations not selecting from one.
Hint,Think about the SQL WHERE clause - what relational algebra operation does it correspond to?,,
Feedback,Selection (σ) = WHERE clause (choose rows). Projection (π) = SELECT columns (choose columns). Selection is horizontal; Projection is vertical.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-009,,,
Title,Join Types,,,
QuestionText,What type of join operation combines tuples from two relations based on a matching condition?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,Natural Join only,,Natural join does this but it's not the only type.
Option,0,Theta Join only,,Theta join does this but it's not the only type.
Option,0,Equijoin only,,Equijoin does this but it's not the only type.
Option,100,All of the above,,Correct! Theta joins use any comparison; Equijoins use equality; Natural joins auto-match on common attributes.
Hint,Think about the different ways to specify join conditions - equality any comparison or automatic matching.,,
Feedback,Theta Join (θ) = any comparison condition. Equijoin = theta join using only equality (=). Natural Join = equijoin that auto-matches common attribute names and removes duplicates.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-010,,,
Title,SELECT Statement Order,,,
QuestionText,What is the correct order of clauses in a SELECT statement?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,SELECT WHERE FROM GROUP BY HAVING ORDER BY,,FROM must come before WHERE.
Option,100,SELECT FROM WHERE GROUP BY HAVING ORDER BY,,Correct! This is the proper order: S-F-W-G-H-O.
Option,0,FROM SELECT WHERE GROUP BY ORDER BY HAVING,,HAVING must come after GROUP BY not after ORDER BY.
Option,0,SELECT FROM GROUP BY WHERE HAVING ORDER BY,,WHERE must come before GROUP BY to filter rows first.
Hint,Memory trick: Some Frogs Will Get Hungry Often.,,
Feedback,Correct order: SELECT (columns) FROM (table) WHERE (row filter) GROUP BY (grouping) HAVING (group filter) ORDER BY (sorting). WHERE filters rows; HAVING filters groups!,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-011,,,
Title,Aggregate Function Count,,,
QuestionText,Which aggregate function would you use to find the total number of rentals in the Rentals table?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,SUM(rental_id),,SUM adds up values not counts rows. This would sum the IDs which is meaningless.
Option,100,COUNT(*),,Correct! COUNT(*) counts all rows including those with NULL values.
Option,0,AVG(rental_id),,AVG calculates average not count. This would average the IDs which is meaningless.
Option,0,MAX(rental_id),,MAX finds the maximum value not the count of rows.
Hint,You want to know HOW MANY rentals exist - which function COUNTS?,,
Feedback,COUNT(*) = counts all rows. COUNT(column) = counts non-NULL values in that column. SUM = adds values. AVG = calculates average. MIN/MAX = finds minimum/maximum.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-012,,,
Title,LIKE Wildcard,,,
QuestionText,What wildcard character is used with the LIKE operator to match any sequence of characters?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,? (question mark),,The question mark is not a SQL wildcard character.
Option,0,* (asterisk),,Asterisk is used in file systems but not in SQL LIKE patterns.
Option,100,% (percent sign),,Correct! The percent sign matches zero or more characters in SQL.
Option,0,# (hash),,The hash symbol is not a SQL wildcard character.
Hint,This character can match nothing or everything - from zero to infinite characters.,,
Feedback,SQL wildcards: % (percent) = matches zero or more characters. _ (underscore) = matches exactly ONE character. Example: 'The%' finds titles starting with The.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-013,,,
Title,INNER vs LEFT JOIN,,,
QuestionText,What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,No difference they are the same,,These joins produce different result sets.
Option,100,LEFT JOIN includes unmatched rows from the left table,,Correct! LEFT JOIN returns all left table rows plus matching right table rows (NULLs for non-matches).
Option,0,INNER JOIN is faster,,Performance depends on data and indexes not the join type.
Option,0,LEFT JOIN only works with two tables,,LEFT JOIN can be used with multiple tables just like INNER JOIN.
Hint,Think about what happens to members who have never rented a movie in Members LEFT JOIN Rentals.,,
Feedback,INNER JOIN = only matching rows. LEFT JOIN = all left rows + matches. RIGHT JOIN = all right rows + matches. FULL JOIN = all rows from both tables.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-014,,,
Title,EXISTS Operator,,,
QuestionText,What does the EXISTS operator do in a subquery?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,Returns all rows from the subquery,,EXISTS doesn't return rows; it returns TRUE or FALSE.
Option,100,Checks if the subquery returns any rows,,Correct! EXISTS returns TRUE if the subquery returns at least one row; FALSE otherwise.
Option,0,Counts rows in the subquery,,COUNT counts rows; EXISTS only checks if any exist.
Option,0,Joins tables together,,JOIN combines tables; EXISTS tests for existence.
Hint,EXISTS returns a boolean value - it asks 'does this query find anything?',,
Feedback,EXISTS = TRUE if subquery returns ≥1 row. NOT EXISTS = TRUE if subquery returns 0 rows. More efficient than COUNT(*) > 0 because it stops after finding one row!,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-015,,,
Title,UNION vs UNION ALL,,,
QuestionText,Which set operation removes duplicate rows when combining results from two queries?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,UNION ALL,,UNION ALL keeps all duplicates for better performance.
Option,100,UNION,,Correct! UNION combines results and automatically removes duplicate rows.
Option,0,INTERSECT,,INTERSECT returns only rows appearing in BOTH queries not combining them.
Option,0,EXCEPT,,EXCEPT returns rows in the first query but not in the second.
Hint,The plain version removes duplicates; the ALL version keeps them.,,
Feedback,UNION = combines and removes duplicates. UNION ALL = combines and keeps duplicates (faster). INTERSECT = only common rows. EXCEPT/MINUS = rows in first but not second.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-016,,,
Title,Index Purpose,,,
QuestionText,What database object is used to speed up query performance by providing fast data lookup?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,View,,Views simplify queries but don't improve performance themselves.
Option,100,Index,,Correct! Indexes provide fast lookups like a book index making SELECT queries faster.
Option,0,Trigger,,Triggers automatically execute code in response to events; they don't speed up queries.
Option,0,Stored Procedure,,Stored procedures are precompiled code but don't directly speed up individual queries.
Hint,Think of a book - what helps you quickly find information without reading every page?,,
Feedback,Indexes improve SELECT performance but slow down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE because the index must be maintained. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to measure performance impact!,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-017,,,
Title,View Definition,,,
QuestionText,What is a database VIEW?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,A physical table stored on disk,,Views don't physically store data; they're virtual.
Option,100,A virtual table based on a stored query,,Correct! Views dynamically show query results without storing the data.
Option,0,A backup of the database,,Backups are separate from views.
Option,0,A user's permission level,,Permissions are different from views though views can help implement security.
Hint,Think VIRTUAL - the data appears as a table but is generated on-demand from the underlying query.,,
Feedback,Views are virtual tables that store the query definition not the data. Benefits: simplify complex queries; provide security by hiding columns; maintain logical data independence.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-018,,,
Title,ON DELETE CASCADE,,,
QuestionText,What happens when you delete a parent row that has child rows with ON DELETE CASCADE?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,The delete is rejected with an error,,This happens with RESTRICT not CASCADE.
Option,0,Only the parent row is deleted,,The child rows would become orphaned; CASCADE prevents this.
Option,100,Both parent and child rows are deleted,,Correct! CASCADE automatically deletes dependent child rows.
Option,0,Child rows are set to NULL,,This happens with ON DELETE SET NULL not CASCADE.
Hint,CASCADE means the delete 'cascades' down to related records.,,
Feedback,ON DELETE CASCADE = delete children too. ON DELETE SET NULL = set foreign key to NULL. ON DELETE RESTRICT = prevent deletion if children exist. ON UPDATE CASCADE = update foreign keys when parent changes.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-019,,,
Title,Trigger Definition,,,
QuestionText,What is a database TRIGGER?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,0,A query optimization tool,,Triggers don't optimize queries; they execute code in response to events.
Option,100,Procedure that automatically executes in response to events,,Correct! Triggers fire automatically on INSERT UPDATE or DELETE events.
Option,0,A type of constraint,,Constraints are different; triggers contain procedural code.
Option,0,A backup mechanism,,Backups are separate from triggers.
Hint,Think about what 'pulls the trigger' - certain database events automatically cause this to fire.,,
Feedback,Triggers automatically execute on INSERT UPDATE or DELETE events. Uses: audit logging; enforcing business rules; maintaining derived data. Caution: they add overhead and complexity!,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-020,,,
Title,Data Independence Types,,,
QuestionText,Which type of data independence allows you to change physical storage without affecting the logical schema?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,Logical data independence,,Logical independence relates to changing the conceptual schema not physical storage.
Option,100,Physical data independence,,Correct! Physical independence means internal/physical changes don't affect the conceptual level.
Option,0,External data independence,,This is not a standard term in ANSI-SPARC architecture.
Option,0,Conceptual data independence,,This is not a standard term in ANSI-SPARC architecture.
Hint,Think about adding an index - that's a PHYSICAL change. Does it require changing your application code?,,
Feedback,Physical Data Independence = internal changes don't affect conceptual schema. Logical Data Independence = conceptual changes don't affect external views. Goal: separation of concerns!,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-021,,,
Title,Function vs Procedure Difference,,,
QuestionText,What is a key difference between a stored procedure and a user-defined function?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,0,Functions are faster than procedures,,Performance depends on implementation not the type.
Option,100,Functions must return a value; procedures may not,,Correct! Functions MUST return something; procedures are optional.
Option,0,Procedures can take parameters; functions cannot,,Both can take parameters.
Option,0,Functions are written in SQL; procedures in other languages,,Both can be written in SQL or other languages depending on the DBMS.
Hint,Think about the word FUNCTION - in math a function always returns a result.,,
Feedback,Functions MUST return a value and can be used in SELECT statements. Procedures may not return values and are called with CALL/EXECUTE. Functions should be pure (no side effects); procedures can modify data.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-022,,,
Title,Superkey vs Candidate Key,,,
QuestionText,What is the difference between a superkey and a candidate key?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,0,Superkeys are always larger than candidate keys,,Size doesn't define the difference.
Option,100,A candidate key is a minimal superkey with no unnecessary attributes,,Correct! Candidate keys have no redundant attributes.
Option,0,Superkeys uniquely identify tuples; candidate keys do not,,Both uniquely identify tuples.
Option,0,There is no difference; they are the same,,They are related but different concepts.
Hint,A candidate key is 'minimal' - it can't lose any attributes and still be unique.,,
Feedback,Superkey = any attribute set that uniquely identifies tuples. Candidate Key = minimal superkey (remove any attribute and it's no longer unique). Primary Key = chosen candidate key.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-023,,,
Title,Referential Integrity,,,
QuestionText,What does referential integrity ensure in a database?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,Foreign key values must match existing primary key values or be NULL,,Correct! Referential integrity prevents orphaned records.
Option,0,All primary keys must be integers,,Primary keys can be any data type not just integers.
Option,0,Every table must have exactly one foreign key,,Tables can have zero one or many foreign keys.
Option,0,Primary keys cannot be NULL,,This describes entity integrity not referential integrity.
Hint,Think about the REFERENCE - the foreign key must point to something that exists.,,
Feedback,Referential Integrity = foreign keys must reference existing primary keys or be NULL. Entity Integrity = primary keys cannot be NULL. Domain Integrity = values must be in valid domains.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-024,,,
Title,GROUP BY Purpose,,,
QuestionText,What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause in SQL?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,Groups rows with the same values so aggregate functions can be applied to each group,,Correct! GROUP BY creates groups for aggregate calculations.
Option,0,Sorts the result set in ascending order,,ORDER BY sorts; GROUP BY groups.
Option,0,Filters rows before they are selected,,WHERE filters rows; GROUP BY groups them.
Option,0,Joins multiple tables together,,JOIN combines tables; GROUP BY groups rows.
Hint,Think about calculating COUNT or SUM for each category - you need to GROUP BY that category.,,
Feedback,GROUP BY groups rows with the same values in specified columns. Use with aggregate functions (COUNT SUM AVG MIN MAX). WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters groups after.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-025,,,
Title,HAVING vs WHERE,,,
QuestionText,What is the main difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters groups after grouping,,Correct! WHERE operates on rows; HAVING operates on groups.
Option,0,WHERE is faster than HAVING,,Performance depends on the query not which clause is used.
Option,0,HAVING can only be used with GROUP BY; WHERE works anywhere,,While HAVING typically appears with GROUP BY that's not the key difference.
Option,0,WHERE uses aggregate functions; HAVING does not,,It's the opposite - HAVING can use aggregates; WHERE cannot.
Hint,Think about the execution order: rows are filtered then grouped then groups are filtered.,,
Feedback,WHERE filters individual rows BEFORE grouping. HAVING filters groups AFTER grouping. HAVING can use aggregate functions (COUNT SUM etc); WHERE cannot.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-026,,,
Title,NULL Handling,,,
QuestionText,How does COUNT(column_name) differ from COUNT(*) when dealing with NULL values?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,COUNT(column_name) excludes NULLs; COUNT(*) includes them,,Correct! COUNT(*) counts all rows regardless of NULL values.
Option,0,COUNT(column_name) includes NULLs; COUNT(*) excludes them,,This is backwards.
Option,0,Both treat NULL values the same way,,They treat NULLs differently.
Option,0,Neither can handle NULL values,,Both can handle NULLs but differently.
Hint,COUNT(*) counts rows (including rows with NULLs). COUNT(column) counts non-NULL VALUES.,,
Feedback,COUNT(*) = counts all rows. COUNT(column) = counts only rows where column IS NOT NULL. Other aggregates (SUM AVG MIN MAX) ignore NULLs.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-027,,,
Title,Cartesian Product,,,
QuestionText,What does the Cartesian Product operation produce in relational algebra?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,100,All possible combinations of tuples from two relations,,Correct! It creates every possible pairing of rows from both tables.
Option,0,Only tuples that have matching values,,That describes a join not a Cartesian product.
Option,0,The intersection of two relations,,That describes the INTERSECT operation.
Option,0,Tuples from the first relation only,,That describes a selection or projection not Cartesian product.
Hint,If table A has 10 rows and table B has 5 rows the Cartesian product has 50 rows.,,
Feedback,Cartesian Product (×) produces all possible pairs of tuples. If R has m tuples and S has n tuples R × S has m × n tuples. Usually combined with selection to create joins.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-028,,,
Title,Database Roles,,,
QuestionText,What is the primary responsibility of a Database Administrator (DBA)?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,100,Managing and maintaining the database system including performance security and backups,,Correct! DBAs handle the technical operational aspects of database systems.
Option,0,Writing application code that uses the database,,This is the role of application developers/programmers.
Option,0,Defining business rules and data requirements,,This is the role of the Data Architect or business analysts.
Option,0,Running queries to generate reports,,This is the role of end users or report developers.
Hint,The DBA is responsible for keeping the database running smoothly securely and efficiently.,,
Feedback,DBA = manages technical operations (performance security backup recovery). Data Architect = plans data strategy. Database Designers = create schemas. Programmers = write applications. End Users = query data.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-029,,,
Title,ACID Properties,,,
QuestionText,In database transactions what does the 'A' in ACID stand for?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,Atomicity,,Correct! Atomicity means transactions are all-or-nothing.
Option,0,Availability,,Availability is not part of ACID (it's part of CAP theorem).
Option,0,Authorization,,Authorization relates to security not transaction properties.
Option,0,Aggregation,,Aggregation is a query operation not a transaction property.
Hint,Think about atoms - they can't be divided. Transactions are similar: they happen completely or not at all.,,
Feedback,ACID: Atomicity (all-or-nothing); Consistency (valid state to valid state); Isolation (transactions don't interfere); Durability (committed changes persist). These ensure reliable transaction processing.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-030,,,
Title,Three-Tier Architecture,,,
QuestionText,What are the three tiers in a three-tier database application architecture?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,Presentation tier; Application/Logic tier; Data tier,,Correct! Frontend; Backend/API; Database.
Option,0,User tier; Database tier; Network tier,,These are not the standard three tiers.
Option,0,Input tier; Processing tier; Output tier,,These don't describe three-tier architecture.
Option,0,External tier; Conceptual tier; Internal tier,,These describe ANSI-SPARC not three-tier application architecture.
Hint,Think about web applications: what the user sees; the API/business logic; the database.,,
Feedback,Three-tier: Presentation (UI/Frontend); Application (Business logic/API); Data (Database). Benefits: separation of concerns; maintainability; scalability. Different from ANSI-SPARC architecture!,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-031,,,
Title,Subquery Types,,,
QuestionText,What type of subquery returns a single value that can be used with comparison operators?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,100,Scalar subquery,,Correct! Scalar subqueries return exactly one value (one row one column).
Option,0,Correlated subquery,,Correlated refers to how it executes (referencing outer query) not what it returns.
Option,0,Table subquery,,Table subqueries return multiple rows and columns.
Option,0,Row subquery,,Row subqueries return one row but multiple columns.
Hint,SCALAR means a single value - think of scalar as 'one number'.,,
Feedback,Scalar subquery = returns one value (1 row 1 column). Row subquery = one row multiple columns. Table subquery = multiple rows and columns. Correlated = references outer query.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-032,,,
Title,Normalization Purpose,,,
QuestionText,What is the primary goal of database normalization?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,Eliminate redundancy and prevent update anomalies,,Correct! Normalization organizes data to reduce duplication and inconsistencies.
Option,0,Make queries run faster,,Normalization can sometimes slow queries; performance is not the primary goal.
Option,0,Increase the number of tables,,More tables is a result not the goal of normalization.
Option,0,Make the database larger,,Size is not relevant to normalization goals.
Hint,Think about the problems with storing the same information in multiple places.,,
Feedback,Normalization eliminates redundancy and prevents: insertion anomalies; deletion anomalies; update anomalies. Process: move from lower normal forms (1NF 2NF) to higher forms (3NF BCNF) by removing dependencies.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-033,,,
Title,Entity Integrity,,,
QuestionText,What does entity integrity require in the relational model?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,Primary key values cannot be NULL,,Correct! Entity integrity ensures each entity can be uniquely identified.
Option,0,Foreign key values cannot be NULL,,Foreign keys CAN be NULL (optional relationships).
Option,0,All attributes must have values,,Attributes can be NULL unless specified NOT NULL.
Option,0,Every table must have a foreign key,,Tables don't require foreign keys.
Hint,The PRIMARY key must identify each entity - can it do that if it's NULL?,,
Feedback,Entity Integrity = primary keys cannot be NULL (must uniquely identify each tuple). Referential Integrity = foreign keys must match existing primary keys or be NULL. Domain Integrity = values in valid ranges.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-034,,,
Title,DISTINCT Keyword,,,
QuestionText,What does the DISTINCT keyword do in a SELECT statement?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,100,Removes duplicate rows from the result set,,Correct! DISTINCT eliminates duplicate tuples.
Option,0,Sorts the results alphabetically,,ORDER BY sorts; DISTINCT removes duplicates.
Option,0,Filters rows based on a condition,,WHERE filters; DISTINCT removes duplicates.
Option,0,Counts the number of unique values,,COUNT(DISTINCT column) counts unique values but DISTINCT alone just removes duplicates.
Hint,Think about what happens when multiple rows have exactly the same values in all selected columns.,,
Feedback,SELECT DISTINCT removes duplicate rows. Useful when selecting non-key columns. Note: DISTINCT applies to the entire row not individual columns. COUNT(DISTINCT column) counts unique values.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-035,,,
Title,Self Join,,,
QuestionText,What is a self-join in SQL?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,100,Joining a table to itself using table aliases,,Correct! Self-joins compare rows within the same table.
Option,0,A join that automatically matches on common column names,,That describes a natural join not a self-join.
Option,0,A join that returns only matching rows,,That describes an inner join not specifically a self-join.
Option,0,A join that references its own primary key,,All tables reference their primary key; this doesn't define self-join.
Hint,Think about finding employees and their managers when both are in the same Employees table.,,
Feedback,Self-join joins a table to itself using aliases. Example: finding employees and their managers or products and their categories when both are in the same table. Requires table aliases (e1 e2) to distinguish.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-036,,,
Title,Set Difference Operation,,,
QuestionText,What does the EXCEPT (or MINUS) set operation return?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,Rows in the first query but not in the second,,Correct! EXCEPT performs set subtraction.
Option,0,Rows that appear in both queries,,That describes INTERSECT not EXCEPT.
Option,0,All rows from both queries,,That describes UNION not EXCEPT.
Option,0,Rows that appear in exactly one query but not both,,That would be a symmetric difference not available in standard SQL.
Hint,Think 'EXCEPTion' - take the first set EXCEPT remove what's in the second.,,
Feedback,EXCEPT (or MINUS) = rows in first query but NOT in second. INTERSECT = rows in BOTH queries. UNION = rows from BOTH queries (combined). All require compatible column types.,,

Title,Aggregate Function Rules,,,
QuestionText,Which statement about aggregate functions is TRUE?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,Aggregate functions can be used in WHERE clauses,,Aggregate functions cannot appear in WHERE (use HAVING instead).
Option,100,Aggregate functions ignore NULL values except COUNT(*),,Correct! SUM AVG MIN MAX ignore NULLs; COUNT(*) includes rows with NULLs.
Option,0,Multiple aggregate functions cannot be used in the same SELECT,,You can use multiple aggregates in one SELECT.
Option,0,Aggregate functions require GROUP BY,,Aggregates can be used without GROUP BY (for entire table).
Hint,Think about calculating AVG of values - should NULL values affect the average?,,
Feedback,Aggregates (SUM AVG MIN MAX) ignore NULL values. COUNT(*) counts all rows; COUNT(column) ignores NULLs. Cannot use aggregates in WHERE; use HAVING instead. Can use multiple aggregates in one query.,,

ID,CSCI5603-038,,,
Title,Foreign Key Purpose,,,
QuestionText,What is the primary purpose of a foreign key?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,100,Establish and enforce relationships between tables,,Correct! Foreign keys link tables and maintain referential integrity.
Option,0,Uniquely identify each row in a table,,That is the purpose of a primary key not foreign key.
Option,0,Speed up query performance,,That is the purpose of an index not foreign key.
Option,0,Prevent NULL values in a column,,That is the purpose of NOT NULL constraint not foreign key.
Hint,FOREIGN key - it references a key in a FOREIGN (other) table.,,
Feedback,Foreign keys: establish relationships between tables; enforce referential integrity; prevent orphaned records. They reference the primary key of another table (or sometimes the same table for hierarchies).,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-039,,,
Title,CHECK Constraint,,,
QuestionText,What does a CHECK constraint do in SQL?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,Ensures values meet a specified condition,,Correct! CHECK constraints validate data against rules.
Option,0,Verifies that foreign keys reference existing values,,That is referential integrity not CHECK constraint.
Option,0,Prevents NULL values,,That is the NOT NULL constraint not CHECK.
Option,0,Ensures uniqueness of values,,That is the UNIQUE constraint not CHECK.
Hint,CHECK constraints let you specify custom business rules like 'age must be between 0 and 120'.,,
Feedback,CHECK constraints enforce domain integrity with custom conditions. Examples: age > 0; price >= 0; rating IN ('G' 'PG' 'R'). They validate data during INSERT/UPDATE operations.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-040,,,
Title,ALTER TABLE Purpose,,,
QuestionText,What is the ALTER TABLE command used for?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,100,Modify the structure of an existing table,,Correct! ALTER TABLE changes table definitions.
Option,0,Insert new rows into a table,,That is INSERT not ALTER TABLE.
Option,0,Update existing data in a table,,That is UPDATE not ALTER TABLE.
Option,0,Delete a table from the database,,That is DROP TABLE not ALTER TABLE.
Hint,ALTER means to CHANGE - you're changing the table's structure not its data.,,
Feedback,ALTER TABLE modifies table structure: ADD COLUMN; DROP COLUMN; MODIFY COLUMN; ADD/DROP CONSTRAINT. It's DDL not DML. Use for schema changes after table creation.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-041,,,
Title,Query Optimization Tool,,,
QuestionText,Which PostgreSQL command shows the query execution plan and performance metrics?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,DESCRIBE,,DESCRIBE shows table structure not query plans.
Option,0,SHOW PLAN,,This is not a valid PostgreSQL command.
Option,100,EXPLAIN ANALYZE,,Correct! EXPLAIN ANALYZE runs the query and shows the execution plan with actual timings.
Option,0,PROFILE,,This is a MySQL command not PostgreSQL.
Hint,You want to EXPLAIN how the query works and ANALYZE its performance.,,
Feedback,EXPLAIN shows the planned execution. EXPLAIN ANALYZE actually executes and shows real performance metrics (timing rows processed). Use to identify slow operations and optimize queries with indexes.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-042,,,
Title,Correlated Subquery,,,
QuestionText,What makes a subquery 'correlated'?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,100,It references columns from the outer query,,Correct! Correlated subqueries depend on the outer query.
Option,0,It returns multiple rows,,This describes a multi-row subquery not specifically correlated.
Option,0,It uses JOIN operations,,Subqueries can use JOINs but that doesn't make them correlated.
Option,0,It appears in the FROM clause,,Subqueries can appear in FROM but that doesn't make them correlated.
Hint,The inner query is CORRELATED with (depends on) values from the outer query.,,
Feedback,Correlated subquery references outer query columns. Executes once per outer row (can be slow). Example: finding employees earning more than their department average. Non-correlated subqueries execute once independently.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-043,,,
Title,LIKE Escape Character,,,
QuestionText,How do you search for a literal percent sign (%) using the LIKE operator?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,100,Use an escape character like ESCAPE '\' and search for '\%',,Correct! Escape characters let you search for wildcard characters literally.
Option,0,Use double percent signs (%%),,This doesn't work in SQL.
Option,0,Use CONTAINS instead of LIKE,,CONTAINS is for full-text search not pattern matching.
Option,0,It's not possible to search for literal wildcards,,It is possible using escape characters.
Hint,You need to 'escape' the special meaning of % so it's treated as a regular character.,,
Feedback,Use ESCAPE clause: WHERE description LIKE '%\%%' ESCAPE '\' searches for literal %. The backslash escapes the special meaning. Can also escape underscore: '\_' to find literal underscore.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-044,,,
Title,Transaction Isolation,,,
QuestionText,What does transaction isolation prevent?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,100,Interference between concurrent transactions,,Correct! Isolation ensures transactions don't affect each other.
Option,0,Data from being permanently stored,,Durability ensures permanent storage not isolation.
Option,0,Transactions from being partially completed,,Atomicity prevents partial completion not isolation.
Option,0,Invalid data from being entered,,Consistency and constraints prevent invalid data not isolation.
Hint,The 'I' in ACID - transactions are ISOLATED from each other.,,
Feedback,Isolation prevents: dirty reads (reading uncommitted data); non-repeatable reads (data changes during transaction); phantom reads (new rows appear). Levels: Read Uncommitted; Read Committed; Repeatable Read; Serializable.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-045,,,
Title,Stored Procedure Benefits,,,
QuestionText,What is a key benefit of using stored procedures?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,Precompiled code that improves performance and reduces network traffic,,Correct! Stored procedures are compiled once and reduce client-server communication.
Option,0,They can be used in SELECT statements like functions,,Functions can be used in SELECT; procedures cannot.
Option,0,They always return a value,,Procedures may not return values; functions must.
Option,0,They cannot modify data,,Procedures CAN modify data.
Hint,Stored procedures live on the database server and execute there - think about network benefits.,,
Feedback,Stored procedure benefits: precompiled (faster execution); reduce network traffic (send procedure name not full SQL); centralize business logic; improve security (grant EXECUTE not direct table access); support complex operations.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-046,,,
Title,Database Schema Definition,,,
QuestionText,What is a database schema?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,2,,,
Option,100,The structure and organization of the database including tables and relationships,,Correct! Schema defines the blueprint of the database.
Option,0,The actual data stored in the database,,Data is separate from schema; schema is the structure.
Option,0,A backup copy of the database,,Backups are copies; schema is the structure definition.
Option,0,The permissions assigned to users,,Permissions are security; schema is structure.
Hint,Think of schema as the architectural blueprint - it shows the structure but not the contents.,,
Feedback,Schema = database structure definition (tables columns data types constraints relationships). Data = actual values stored. Schema is defined by DDL (CREATE ALTER DROP). Multiple schemas can exist in one database.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-047,,,
Title,Projection Operation,,,
QuestionText,What does the projection operation do in relational algebra?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,0,Selects specific rows based on a condition,,That describes selection (σ) not projection.
Option,100,Selects specific columns and removes duplicates,,Correct! Projection (π) creates a vertical subset of columns.
Option,0,Combines two relations,,That describes join or union not projection.
Option,0,Renames attributes in a relation,,That describes a rename operation not projection.
Hint,Think of projecting a 3D object onto a 2D surface - you're showing only certain dimensions.,,
Feedback,Projection (π) selects columns (vertical subset) and removes duplicates. Example: π<sub>title genre</sub>(Movies) shows only title and genre columns. Selection (σ) selects rows (horizontal subset).,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-048,,,
Title,ANY vs ALL Operators,,,
QuestionText,What is the difference between ANY and ALL operators in SQL subqueries?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,100,ANY requires condition to be true for at least one value; ALL requires it for every value,,Correct! ANY = exists one; ALL = for all.
Option,0,ANY is faster than ALL,,Performance is not the distinguishing factor.
Option,0,ANY returns multiple rows; ALL returns one row,,Both are comparison operators; they don't return rows.
Option,0,There is no difference; they are synonyms,,They have opposite meanings.
Hint,ANY = at least one match. ALL = every single one matches.,,
Feedback,ANY (or SOME) = condition true for at least one value in subquery. ALL = condition true for every value. Example: salary > ALL (subquery) means greater than the maximum. salary > ANY (subquery) means greater than the minimum.,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-049,,,
Title,Denormalization Purpose,,,
QuestionText,Why might you intentionally denormalize a database?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,100,To improve query performance by reducing joins,,Correct! Denormalization trades redundancy for speed.
Option,0,To eliminate all redundancy,,Normalization eliminates redundancy; denormalization adds it back.
Option,0,To follow best practices,,Best practice is normalization; denormalization is a strategic exception.
Option,0,To reduce storage space,,Denormalization increases storage due to redundancy.
Hint,Sometimes breaking normalization rules can make queries faster - but at what cost?,,
Feedback,Denormalization intentionally adds redundancy to improve read performance. Tradeoff: faster SELECT queries but slower INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE and potential inconsistency. Use when read performance is critical (reporting data warehouses).,,

NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,CSCI5603-050,,,
Title,Composite Key,,,
QuestionText,What is a composite key?,,,
Points,2,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Option,100,A primary key consisting of two or more columns,,Correct! Composite keys use multiple columns for unique identification.
Option,0,A foreign key that references multiple tables,,Foreign keys reference one table; this doesn't define composite key.
Option,0,A key that combines primary and foreign key constraints,,Keys are either primary or foreign not both.
Option,0,An automatically generated numeric key,,That describes a surrogate key not composite key.
Hint,COMPOSITE means made up of multiple parts - multiple COLUMNS together form the key.,,
Feedback,Composite (or compound) key uses multiple columns to uniquely identify tuples. Example: Rentals table might use (member_id movie_id rental_date) as composite primary key. Common in junction/bridge tables for many-to-many relationships.,,
